## Introduction to Python programming
This repository contains folders and notes from my Introduction to Python programming course.

This repository is separated into folders for each section of the course. Course materials are located in the "SuperDataScience files" folders within each section folder. Jupyter Notebook files for each section are labeled with the section number and topic and are located within their respective section folders.
